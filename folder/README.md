PES University , Bangalore 

We have created a Movie Search Web Application written on top of MERN STACK
M -> MongoDB (Database)
E -> ExpressJs (Nodejs Web framework acts as a middle end to allow the front end to connect to the back end via API's)
R -> ReactJs ( Javascript utility framework allows to write front end with easy state and effect management )
N -> Node Js (Javascript web server)


We use the infamous moviesdbapi  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3 which allowed us to fetch data and meta data of movie via API keys provided.

We made our website interactive and responsive which suggested and displayed movies filtered based on movie release date.

Our website had  a functionality of adding movies to favourites and also commenting on the movies , only after the user is registered and Signed into our website.
